# my tmux config
To clone this config, run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sawsent/tmux ~/.config/
```

To get it working, you need to install tpm first on `~/.tmux/plugins/`. See [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) or run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Then, inside a tmux session, use `<prefix> I` to install plugins!

Please see [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for more details.
