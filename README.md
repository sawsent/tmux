# my tmux config
To copy this config and get it working, you need to install tpm first on `~/.tmux/plugins/`, and install each plugin.

To do this, you can run, or see [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Then, inside a tmux session, use `<prefix> I` to install plugins!

Please see [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for more details.
